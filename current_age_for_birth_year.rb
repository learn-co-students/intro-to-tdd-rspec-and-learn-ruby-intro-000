def current_age_for_birth_year (birth_year)
  #2003 is the "currenet year" this would be better as a library if current year was abstracted
  #So this is saying subtract birth year from current year. Your argument is the little input that this method or machine takes in
  #So elsewhere I can load this at the top and use puts current_age_for_birth_year(x) to get my answer
  2003 - birth_year
